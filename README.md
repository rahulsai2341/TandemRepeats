# TandemRepeats
Survey of various algorithms to find tandem repeats.

Tandem repeat is a sequence of two or more DNA base pairs that are repeated multiple times consecutively. 
They are generally associated with non-coding DNA. Tandem repeats are helpful to determine the inherited traits of a gene from its parent and in determining the ancestor relationship. They are proven to be biologically significant as they can help in the discovery of dynamic mutations for genetic diseases. In this paper, we discuss five different methods to find tandem repeats in each sequence.
